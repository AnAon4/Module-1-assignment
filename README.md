#Code Refactor Project for Module 1
We were told to take files for the horiseon website and clean up the code.
Tasks given to clean up the code
- Add semantic tags to add meaning to the different sections of code.
- Organize the code in proper indentation and structure
- include all accesibility features, for instance alt tags for images.
- Give the website a proper title.

I did just that. Taking all the starting code and modifying to meet the standards that the project required.

I also added my files to my personal github live page to display it.
